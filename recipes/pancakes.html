    <h2>Fluffy Flapjack Pancakes Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time.
      The recipe can be easily adjusted to your dietary needs, too. I have tried
      many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof! A word of
      caution: they're very filling.
