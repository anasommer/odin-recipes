    <h2>Fluffy Flapjack Pancakes Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      These flapjack pancakes are quick, easy, and turn out fluffy every time.
      The recipe can be easily adjusted to your dietary needs, too. I have tried
      many recipes; this one is simple, yummy, and fail-proof! A word of
      caution: they're very filling.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>2 cups milk</li>

      <li>2 eggs</li>

      <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>

      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
        bowl until no lumps remain. Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter
        is runny and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking
        spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake
        onto the preheated grill and cook until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes.
        Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until bottom is
        lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
